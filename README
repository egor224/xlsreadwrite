1. Overview:

     'xlsReadWrite' is a packages which allows to read and write Excel
     files.  Currently supported is the .xls (BIFF8) file format.

     Please type 'help(package = "xlsReadWrite")', '?read.xls',
     '?write.xls' and '?xls.getshlib' to learn about the package and
     the actual commands and usage.

     The main plus points:

        • it is fast

        • well documented and (RUnit) tested

        • the package does _not_ have any external dependencies

        • it has a nice simple interface and _just works fine_ (since
          ~4 years)

     Regarding the less rosy side: 'xlsReadWrite' - still - is windows
     only and uses proprietary 3rd party code (which means only our own
     code is, and can be, free). The package is written in Pascal, a
     very nice language, but a bit an obscure thing in the R world.

     In 2011 Delphi should be released for Mac/Linux incl. a 64 bit
     preview and we plan to support those platforms then (depending on
     job requirements, maybe already earlier through FreePascal). The
     underlying library is being developed for .xlsx (quite a long time
     already) and so there is hope to support the .xlsx format sometime
     in future. Probably as a separate package, but we will see.

     xlsReadWrite is not the only possibility to interface Excel.
     Besides the _pro_ shareware version (see below) there are the
     following packages: _RODBC_ (drivers), _gdata_ (Perl), _RExcel_ or
     _COM_ (Excel), _dataframes2xls_ (Python), _xlsx_ (Apache POI,
     Java) and, of course, using plain old _.csv_ files. Note,
     dependencies have been mentioned in brackets.

3. Tests and compiling:

     TESTS

     The enclosed RUnit tests help us maintaining the quality and kind
     of secure what happens in certain circumstances, e.g. when column
     types for data.frames will be determined. Or with the, sometimes,
     quite complicated col-/rownames behaviour. Otherwise they provide
     additional user examples and give assurance that things work
     correctly on a local system.

     You may run the approx. 50 unit tests with the following code:

     
     
                 # adapt path
             ruDir <- "C:/Programme/R/R-2.11.0/library/xlsReadWrite/unitTests" 
     
                 # note: RUnit package needed
             library(RUnit); library(xlsReadWrite)
     
                 # source and run (output goes to current working dir) 
             source(file.path(ruDir, "loadRUnit.R"))
             .setup(ruDir, getwd())
             execTestSuite(ruDir, getwd())
         

     COMPILING

     Prerequisites: Delphi 2007 and Flexcel
     (http://www.tmssoftware.com, a high-quality code library for the
     core Excel-work).

     Then follow these steps:

       1. Clone the github repo and initialize the RPascal submodule

       2. Adapt paths in 'include.mk'

       3. Make sure that the RTools are in your path (as first entry!)

       4. Regarding Flexcel code:

            • in FLXCOMPILER.INC: disable the FLEXCEL define, e.g.
              '.$DEFINE FLEXCEL'

            • 'src/pas/vFlexcelCommits.txt' has the currently used
              Flexcel version

       5. Compile:

            • open a console in the root folder and execute 'make
              build-reg' or

            • open the Delphi project file, adapt paths, host
              application, and press F9...

4. CRAN version and xlsReadWritePro:

     CRAN

     Besides the _regular_ 'xlsReadWrite' package there is a special
     _cran_ version.  Reason (copied from the cran version startup
     message):
     
     
             "BACKGROUND: Our own xlsReadWrite code is free, but we also use proprietary code\n"
             "(Flexcel, tmssoftware.com) which can only be distributed legally in precompiled,\n"
             "i.e. binary form. As CRAN 'generally does not accept submissions of precompiled\n"
             "binaries due to security reasons' we only provide a placeholder and you can\n"
             "download the binary shlib separately.\n\n";
         

     XLSREADWRITEPRO

     The pro version is our second attempt and goes further than the
     free version:

        • append data to existing files,

        • work with in-memory objects, e.g. to compose Excel reports
          with multiple sheets,

        • address confined data areas: rows, cols and from, to; (named)
          ranges and picking from individual cells,

        • manage sheets (select, insert, copy, rename, delete, hide),

        • read/write formula values,

        • support images (add, delete, count, list and export),

        • additional oleDateTime helper functions,

        • last but not least: formal support contact.

     By purchasing the 'xlsReadWritePro' shareware version you help
     support our development and maintenance effort. We are grateful
     that quite some people and companies did and both, the free and
     the pro version shall benefit. The trial (http://www.swissr.org)
     is free and the two versions do coexist just fine. So, why not
     check out 'xlsReadWritePro' now and see for yourself?

5. Contact/feedback:

     The preferred communication channel is the forum (<URL:
     http://dev.swissr.org/projects/xlsreadwrite/boards>). Otherwise by
     email, _support at swissr.org_ or - for pro version users -
     _hans-peter.suter at treetron.ch_.
