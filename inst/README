OVERVIEW
--------

xlsReadWrite and xlsReadWritePro are packages to natively read/write/manage Excel
spreadsheet files. It's one choice among others: RODBC (drivers), gdata (Perl), 
RExcel or COM (Excel), dataframes2xls (Python), Apache POI (Java) and - of course - 
working with plain old csv files. 

The xlsReadWrite(Pro) packages do not have any external dependencies (as indicated 
in the brackets above). They are fast, have a nice simple interface and 'just work'.
However they are - currently - windows only, contain proprietary 3rd party code and 
are written in Pascal (great language, but a bit singular in the Rworld).

SOURCE & COMPILING
------------------

Our own xlsReadWrite code is open source (see LICENSE). xlsReadWrite*Pro* is non-free 
and a separate agreement is required for repository access. The 'Excel-work' is beeing
done by Flexcel, a proprietary, well tested, high quality code library from TMS Software
(http://www.tmssoftware.com). To compile the package from source you need a Flexcel license. 

Compiling is easy enough, follow these steps:

- (Current prerequisites: Delphi 2007, Flexcel license/code)
- Clone the github repo and don't forget to initialize the RPascal submodule
- Adapt paths in 'include.mk'
- Make sure that the RTools are in your path (as first entries!)
- Regarding Flexcel code:
  - TFlexCelImport and TXLSAdapter derive from TObject instead of TComponent
  - The Flexcel source files are originally stored in quite a lot of different folders. 
    We copied all .pas, .inc and .res files in a single folder and set the Delphi path to this folder.
  - Other minor changes (TODO: should be documented)
- Compile:
  - either open a console in the root folder and execute 'make check' and/or 'make build' or
  - open the Delphi project file, adapt (paths, host application) and press F9...


XLSREADWRITEPRO VERSION
-----------------------

By purchasing xlsReadWritePro you help support our development and maintenance effort. 
We are grateful that quite some people and companies did, and both, the free and pro
version shall benefit (e.g. crossplatform, which is not done on a lazy afternoon...).

xlsReadWritePro is our second attempt. It has more features but also is considerably more 
complex. We are commited to maintain both versions well and - maybe depending a little 
on your support - to backport features from pro to the free version (if technically viable).
  
!! NOTE: xlsReadWritePro works well up to R 2.9.x but not yet on the new R 2.10 version!
The reason is, that we are currently reorganizing internal things (git/redmine/web/distr/make).
We started with the free version and the pro version will follow.

Currently we are reorganizing some internal things (git/redmine/web/distrib/make). We
started with the free version and the pro version will follow soon (TODO: update when done).


CONTACT/FEEDBACK
----------------

The prefered 'communication channel' is the redmine.swissr.org forum. Otherwise you can reach
me at 'chappi at swissr.org' or - for pro version users - at 'hans-peter.suter at treetron.ch'.
