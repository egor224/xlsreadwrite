OVERVIEW
--------

xlsReadWrite and xlsReadWritePro are packages to natively read/write/manage Excel
spreadsheet files. They support the .xls format (BIFF8) and have been tested up to 
Excel version 2010 (Beta). The test files have been included (see inst/RUnitTests)
to let you ensure that everything works and to provide more extensive example code.

The packages do not have external dependencies (see brackets of alternatives, below). 
They are fast, have a nice simple interface and 'just work'. On the other side they 
are - still - windows only, use 3rd party code and are written in Pascal (not to say
that this is a bad language... quite the opposite imho). xlsReadWrite(Pro) is a choice 
among others: RODBC (drivers), gdata (Perl), RExcel or COM (Excel), dataframes2xls 
(Python), Apache POI (Java) and working with plain old .csv files. 

It's likely that Linux/Mac support will be added this year and xlsx support should 
also arrive - but plans may change...

COMPILING FROM SOURCE
---------------------

The 'Excel-work' is done by Flexcel, a high quality code library from TMS Software 
(http://www.tmssoftware.com). To compile the package you need a Flexcel license.

Steps to compile xlsReadWrite:

- (Current prerequisites: Delphi 2007, Flexcel license)
- Clone the github repo and initialize the RPascal submodule
- Adapt paths in 'include.mk'
- Make sure that the RTools are in your path (as first entries!)
- Regarding Flexcel code:
  - in FLXCOMPILER.INC: disable the FLEXCEL define, e.g. '{.$DEFINE FLEXCEL}'
  - 'src/pas/vFlexcelCommits.txt' has the currently used Flexcel version
- Compile:
  - open a console in the root folder and execute 'make check' and/or 'make build' or
  - open the Delphi project file, adapt (paths, host application) and press F9...


XLSREADWRITEPRO VERSION
-----------------------

By purchasing xlsReadWritePro you help support our development and maintenance effort. 
We are grateful that quite some people and companies did, and both, the free and pro
version shall benefit (e.g. crossplatform, which is not done on a lazy afternoon...).

xlsReadWritePro is our second attempt. It has more features but also is considerably more 
complex. We are commited to maintain both versions well and - maybe depending a little 
on your support - to backport features from pro to the free version (if technically viable).
  
!! NOTE: xlsReadWritePro works well up to R 2.9.x but not yet on the new R 2.10 version!

(The reason is, that we are currently reorganizing internal things (git/redmine/web/distr/make).
We started with the free version (which is now finished) and the pro version will follow
shortly. Please see http://www.swissr.org for current state).


CONTACT/FEEDBACK
----------------

The preferred 'communication channel' is the redmine.swissr.org forum. Otherwise you can reach
me at 'chappi at swissr.org' or - pro version users - also at 'hans-peter.suter at treetron.ch'.
