OVERVIEW
--------

xlsReadWrite and xlsReadWritePro are packages which allow to read, write 
and manage Excel files. Currently supported is the .xls (BIFF8) file format.
  
The packages do not have any external dependencies (see brackets of alternatives,
below). They are fast, have a nice simple interface and 'just work great'.
On the other side they are - still - windows only, limited in comparison to 
some alternatives, use 3rd party code and are written in Pascal (not to say that
this is a bad language... quite the opposite imho, just its not common in the R world). 

xlsReadWrite[Pro] is one possibility among others: RODBC (drivers), gdata (Perl), 
RExcel or COM (Excel), dataframes2xls (Python), xlsx (Apache POI, Java) and - of 
course - working with plain old .csv files. 

It's likely that Linux/Mac support will be added this year and xlsx support should 
also arrive - but plans may change...

TESTS AND COMPILING
-------------------

### Tests
 
See the RUnitTests folder for the included test files. They provide many more
examples and let you check that everything works well on your system:

<code>
library(RUnit); library(xlsReadWrite)
  # adapt path
ruDir <- "C:/Programme/R/R-2.10.1/library/xlsReadWrite/RUnitTests" 
source( file.path( ruDir, "runner.R" ) )
runTests( ruDir )
</code>

### Compiling

The 'Excel-work' is done by Flexcel, a high quality code library from TMS Software 
(http://www.tmssoftware.com). To compile the package you need a Flexcel license.

Steps to compile xlsReadWrite:

- (Current prerequisites: Delphi 2007, Flexcel license)
- Clone the github repo and initialize the RPascal submodule
- Adapt paths in 'include.mk'
- Make sure that the RTools are in your path (as first entries!)
- Regarding Flexcel code:
  - in FLXCOMPILER.INC: disable the FLEXCEL define, e.g. '{.$DEFINE FLEXCEL}'
  - 'src/pas/vFlexcelCommits.txt' has the currently used Flexcel version
- Compile:
  - open a console in the root folder and execute 'make check' and/or 'make build' or
  - open the Delphi project file, adapt (paths, host application) and press F9...


XLSREADWRITEPRO AND CRAN VERSION
--------------------------------

### xlsReadWritePro version

By purchasing xlsReadWritePro you help support our development and maintenance effort. 
We are grateful that quite some people and companies did, and both, the free and pro
version shall benefit (e.g. crossplatform, which is not done on a lazy afternoon...).

xlsReadWritePro is our second attempt. It has more features but also is considerably more 
complex. We are commited to maintain both versions well and - maybe depending a little 
on your support - to backport features from pro to the free version (if technically viable).
  
!! NOTE: xlsReadWritePro works well up to R 2.9.x but not yet on the new R 2.10 version!

(The reason is, that we are currently reorganizing internal things (git/redmine/web/distr/make).
We started with the free version (which is now finished) and the pro version will follow
shortly. Please see http://www.swissr.org for current state).

### Cran version

Besides the regular xlsReadWrite package there is a special cran version, reason:

	(copied from the cran version startup message)
	
  "BACKGROUND: Our own xlsReadWrite code is free, but we also use proprietary code\n"
  "(Flexcel, tmssoftware.com) which can only be distributed legally in precompiled,\n"
  "i.e. binary form. As CRAN 'generally does not accept submissions of precompiled\n"
  "binaries due to security reasons' we only provide a placeholder and you can\n"
  "download the binary shlib separately.\n\n";


CONTACT/FEEDBACK
----------------

The preferred 'communication channel' is the redmine.swissr.org forum. Otherwise 
you can reach me at 'chappi at swissr.org' or - pro version users - also at 
'hans-peter.suter at treetron.ch'.
